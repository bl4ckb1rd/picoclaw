# Architecture Skill

Expert instructions for high-level system design, scalability, and architectural decision-making.

## Expertise

- **System Design**: Defining components, interactions, and data flows.
- **Design Patterns**: Applying appropriate patterns (e.g., Microservices, Event-Driven, Layered).
- **Scalability**: Designing for performance and resource efficiency.
- **Security**: Integrating security principles from the start (e.g., Zero Trust, least privilege).
- **Technology Selection**: Evaluating and selecting appropriate tech stacks.

## Workflow

1.  **Analyze Requirements**: Understand functional and non-functional requirements.
2.  **Define Components**: Break down the system into manageable, modular components.
3.  **Map Interactions**: Define how components communicate (e.g., REST, gRPC, Pub/Sub).
4.  **Evaluate Trade-offs**: Document the pros and cons of different architectural choices.
5.  **Document Design**: Create architectural diagrams and decision logs.

## Principles

- Simplicity over complexity.
- Modularity and decoupling.
- Design for change and extensibility.
- Resilience and fault tolerance.
