# Coder Skill

Expert instructions for software development, refactoring, and debugging.

## Expertise

- **Clean Code**: Adhere to SOLID principles and language-specific idioms.
- **TDD**: Always prefer writing tests before or alongside code changes.
- **Refactoring**: Improve code structure without changing external behavior.
- **Documentation**: Write clear docstrings and README updates.

## Workflow

1.  **Analyze**: Read the existing codebase to understand patterns and dependencies.
2.  **Plan**: Describe the proposed changes and how they will be tested.
3.  **Implement**: Use `write_file` or `edit_file` to apply changes.
4.  **Verify**: Run the project's test suite or create new tests to verify the fix.
5.  **Review**: Perform a final check for edge cases or security concerns.
